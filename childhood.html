                    <h2>Growing Up in Kenya</h2>
                    <p>
                        I grew up in Kenya a town in Trans-nzoia that is Kitale, and honestly, my childhood was pretty normal. Nothing 
                        too dramatic or special, just a kid trying to figure out what he liked 
                        and what he wanted to do with his life. But looking back, there were 
                        definitely some signs of who I was going to become.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>The Curious Kid</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was always that kid who wanted to know how things worked. If something 
                        was broken at home, I'd be the first one trying to open it up and see 
                        what was inside. Radios, old phones, even my dad's watch once (of course he wasn't 
                        too happy about that one). I just couldn't help it and I needed to understand 
                        what made things work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Computers fascinated me the most. The first time I used one, I remember 
                        being completely amazed that you could type something and it would just... 
                        appear on the screen. It sounds silly now, but back then it felt like magic to me.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>Music Was Always There</h2>
                    <p>
                        Music was a big part of our household. My parents played all kinds of 
                        music starting from gospel, oldies, some local Kenyan hits. I remember listening to 
                        the radio and trying to figure out why some songs just made you want to 
                        move, while others didn't have the same effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wasn't thinking about becoming a DJ back then,that came much later. 
                        But I was definitely paying attention to beats and rhythms more than 
                        most kids my age. My friends would be playing outside and nicknaming me 'DJ', and I'd be inside 
                        listening to the same song on repeat, trying to understand its structure.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>School Days</h2>
                    <p>
                        School was okay. I wasn't the top student, but I wasn't struggling either. 
                        I did well in subjects I cared about and just got by in the ones I didn't. 
                        Looking back, I wish I had paid more attention in some classes, but that's 
                        how it goes when you're young — you don't always see the bigger picture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The subjects I liked most were anything that let me be creative or solve 
                        problems. Physics class was fun. Math made sense to me most of the time. 
                        Computer studies, once we had that, became my favorite period of the week.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>First Experiences with Technology</h2>
                    <p>
                        My first real experience with technology beyond just using it was in 
                        secondary school. We had a computer lab, and I spent as much time there 
                        as I could. I learned the basics like typing, using Microsoft Office, some 
                        simple stuff with the internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what really got me excited was when I discovered that you could 
                        actually make things with computers. Not just use programs other people 
                        made, but create your own. That realization changed everything for me.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>The Seeds Were Planted</h2>
                    <p>
                        By the time I finished secondary school, I knew two things: I wanted to 
                        do something with computers, and I wanted music to be part of my life 
                        somehow. I didn't know exactly how those two things would come together, 
                        but I knew they were important to me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's how my childhood set the stage for where I am now studying 
                        software engineering while pursuing my passion for DJing on the side. 
                        It's a combination that makes sense to me, even if it seems unusual 
                        to some people.
                    </p>
