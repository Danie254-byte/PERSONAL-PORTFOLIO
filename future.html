                    <h2>The Vision</h2>
                    <p>
                        I think a lot about the future. Not in an anxious way, but more like... 
                        where do I actually want to end up? What kind of life do I want to build? 
                        The answers aren't perfectly clear, but I have a direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to create a career that combines both of my passions — technology 
                        and entertainment. I don't want to choose between being a software engineer 
                        and being a DJ. I want to find a way to do both, and maybe even merge them 
                        into something unique.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Career Goals in Tech</h2>
                    <p>
                        First and foremost, I want to become a competent software engineer. Not just 
                        someone with a degree, but someone who can actually build things that work 
                        and solve real problems.

                    <h2>Where Tech Meets Entertainment</h2>
                    <p>
                        What really excites me is the intersection of technology and entertainment. 
                        There are so many possibilities:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="ideas-list">
                        <li>Building apps or platforms that help independent musicians and DJs</li>
                        <li>Creating tools for music production or event management</li>
                        <li>Developing streaming or content platforms</li>
                        <li>Using data and technology to understand music trends and audience preferences</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I don't know exactly what form this will take yet, but I believe there's 
                        something valuable at this crossroads. And I want to be the person who 
                        builds it.

                    <h2>Impact I Want to Make</h2>
                    <p>
                        Beyond personal success, I want to actually contribute something meaningful. 
                        Whether that's:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="ideas-list">

                    <p>
                        Success means more when you can share it and help others along the way.

                    <h2>Keeping It Real</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'll be honest — I don't have everything figured out. The future is 
                        uncertain, and there will probably be plenty of failures and detours 
                        along the way. But I think that's okay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What matters is having a direction and being willing to work toward it. 
                        The details will figure themselves out as I go. For now, I'm focused on 
                        building my skills, creating good work, and staying open to opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The journey from a curious kid in Kenya to wherever I end up — that's 
                        the story I'm writing. And I'm excited to see how it unfolds.
