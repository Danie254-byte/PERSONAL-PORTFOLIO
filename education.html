                    <h2>Where I Am Now</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently in my second year of studying Software Engineering at 
                        university. It's been a journey — sometimes exciting, sometimes 
                        overwhelming, but always pushing me to learn something new.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Choosing software engineering wasn't a random decision. After years of 
                        being curious about how technology works, it felt like the natural path 
                        to actually understand and create it myself. Plus, the tech industry 
                        in Kenya is growing, and I want to be part of that growth.
                    </p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>What I'm Learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        University has introduced me to so many things I didn't know existed. 
                        It's not just about writing code, though there's plenty of that. 
                        It's about understanding systems, thinking logically, and solving 
                        problems in structured ways.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="skills-list">
                        <h3>Core Subjects I've Covered:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Programming Fundamentals</strong> — Started with the basics, learned how to think like a programmer</li>
                            <li><strong>Web Development</strong> — HTML, CSS, JavaScript — building things for the internet</li>
                            <li><strong>Database Management</strong> — How to store and organize data properly</li>
                            <li><strong>Mathematics</strong> — Discrete math, calculus — the foundation for everything</li>
                            <li><strong>Computer Networks</strong> — How computers talk to each other</li>
                            <li><strong>Software Engineering Principles</strong> — Best practices for building reliable software</li>
                        </ul>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>Learning Through Projects</h2>
                    <p>
                        The best learning happens when you actually build something. Class 
                        projects have taught me more than lectures sometimes. When you're 
                        trying to make something work and it keeps breaking, you learn fast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Group projects have been especially valuable. Working with classmates 
                        who think differently from you, dealing with deadlines, figuring out 
                        how to divide work fairly these are skills that go beyond coding.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>Skills I've Developed</h2>

                        <div class="skill-item">
                            <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
                            <p>Breaking down big problems into smaller, manageable pieces. It's not always easy, but it works.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="skill-item">
                            <h4>Teamwork</h4>
                            <p>Learning to communicate clearly, share ideas, and sometimes disagree respectfully with teammates.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="skill-item">
                            <h4>Time Management</h4>
                            <p>Balancing coursework, DJ gigs, and personal life. Still working on this one, honestly.</p>

                            <h4>Self-Learning</h4>
                            <p>University teaches you the basics, but you have to dig deeper on your own. YouTube tutorials are my friend.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>The Challenges</h2>
                    <p>
                        I won't pretend it's been easy. Some courses are genuinely difficult. 
                        There have been nights where I've stared at code for hours without 
                        understanding why it won't work. There have been exams I wasn't 
                        prepared for and projects that didn't turn out as planned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But I think that's part of the process. Every time I struggle through 
                        something difficult, I come out a bit stronger and more capable. 
                        The frustration is temporary; the skills stick around.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>Balancing Studies and DJing</h2>
                    <p>
                        One thing I've had to figure out is how to balance my academic work 
                        with my DJ career. It's not always easy. Sometimes I have a gig on 
                        a Friday night and an assignment due Monday morning. But I've learned 
                        to plan ahead and prioritize.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interestingly, I think both activities complement each other. The 
                        creativity I use in music helps me think differently about coding 
                        problems. And the logical thinking from programming helps me 
                        organize my music and plan sets better.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>What's Next</h2>
                    <p>
                        I still have a couple of years left in my degree. There's so much 
                        more to learn about mobile app development, cloud computing, maybe some 
                        artificial intelligence. The field is constantly evolving, and that's 
                        both exciting and a little intimidating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But I'm committed to seeing this through and coming out as a capable 
                        software engineer who can actually build useful things.
